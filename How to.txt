How to download pj correctly:
*************************************************
	Open git-bash amd write next commands:
		1.Configure GIT at first:
			1.1. git config --global user.name "Your Name"
			1.2. git config --global user.email "Your mail"
		2. Choose some folder where you want to place repo
			2.1. git clone --branch release/R00 https://github.com/MaximDenisuk/VR_MMO_RPG.git
			2.2. git submodule update --init --recursive

Now you have 2 repos downloaded, in this folder "VR_MMO_RPG" you have project structure + one submodule (also repo) named VR_MMO_RPG_DOCS. The release-branches should be equal for both repo VR_MMO_RPG and VR_MMO_RPG_DOCS.

Have a fun!

How to work inside repo
*************************************************
If you want to make some changes inside repo without updaiting docs, you should create new branch named "develop/<feature name>" for this you need to do next actions:
	0. Find the latest release:
		git branch --all | grep "release/"
	1. Checkout to the latest release:
		git checkout release/R00
	2. Checkout to the new branch based on it:
		git checkout -b develop/CreatingOfHandsControll (adequate feature name, not like MyFf1)
	3. Do some changes that u need, TEST it for regresion and then add them to stage area
		3.1 View changes:
			git status
		3.2 Add changes:
			git add myChangedFile.cpp or git add . (if u are shure that evth is correct)
	4. Commit changes to branch, put here adequate comment about the work result that you have done:
		git commit -m "Left and right hands controll was added"
	5. When all commits are done, push changes to repo
		git push orign develop/CreatingOfHandsControll (your branch name)
	6. After "push" you will see the link like this:
		https://github.com/MaximDenisuk/VR_MMO_RPG/pull/new/develop/NewTestPolygonCreated 
	   Visit it, and then push button "Create Pull request" on github
	7. Move your task to verification section using trelo and attach link to the task in comments

The job is now complete, time to take a break and waiting for review.
